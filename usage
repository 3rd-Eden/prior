prior-inventions:

A simple tool to create a list of prior inventions based on the work that you've
done on GitHub and npm.

Usage:

  $ prior-inventions [optional flags]

The flags allows you to override the default prompt for information so the process
of gathering information starts directly. The following flags will override the
prompt:

--github              Your GitHub username.
--registry            URL to an public npm registry you want to use.

In addition to the flags mentioned above, we also support the following flags:

--format              Select an output formatter for the generated list.
--help                Output's this help message

Formatters:

We support a bunch of default formatters so you can generate a human readable file.
The following formatters are supported:

--format json         Output all the projects in a human readable JSON file.
--format markdown     Write everything in a markdown format.
--format plain        Generate a plain text file.
